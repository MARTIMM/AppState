Abandoned project(for the moment at least). Will not investigate it any further.
It gives me the feeling of an too overly complex project. Also I want to work on
perl6 projects


AppState
========

Software is still in alpha state! I am now creating applications with it to
investicate the usefullness.


INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this set of modules is to group a lot of programs necessities
into one set of modules. In the CPAN are modules for accessing configuration
parameters, writing log files and so on. All using different class names and
some having more options, others less. Now, I wanted this all under one hood
named AppState or Application state.

The AppState object is a singleton which uses the plugin manager to provide
other objects to the user. Such objects are Log, CommandLine and ConfigManager.

Modules
  AppState
    Portal to other modules using plugins

  Plugins:
    ConfigManager
      Configuration handling using several types of storage.

    CommandLine
      Commandline options and arguments.

    Log
      Logging using Log::Log4perl. The extra thing is when messages have a
      higher severity then info, a status object is returned. Log levels are bit
      masks each for specific catagories. Keep first 16 bits reserved for
      AppState. Cannot be checked however.

    NodeTree
      Module to convert a specific perl data structure into a tree of objects.

    PluginManager
      A plugin manager which AppState also uses.
