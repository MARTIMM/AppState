AppState
========

Software is still in alpha state! I am now creating applications with it to
investicate the usefullness.


INTRODUCTION

Inventing the wheel again..... Its purpose is to group a lot of programs
nessessities into one set of modules. In the CPAN are modules for accessing
configuration parameters, write log files and so on. All using different class
names and some having more options, others less. Now, I wanted this all under
one hood named AppState or Application state. Some things can be solved using
existing modules using an adapter pattern others needed to be created anew.

Modules
  AppState
    Portal to other modules using plugins
  
  AppState::Plugins::Feature::ConfigManager
    Configuration handling        

  AppState::Plugins::Feature::Log
    Logging
    Log levels are bit masks each for specific catagories. Keep
    first 16 bits reserved for AppState. Cannot be checked however.

  AppState::Plugins::Feature::Process
    Daemon, fork, process tables etc

  AppState::Plugins::Feature::CommandLine
    Options and arguments, CGI
