AppState
========

Inventing the wheel again..... Its purpose is to group a lot of programs
nessessities into one set of modules. In the CPAN are modules for accessing
configuration parameters, write log files and so on. All using different class
names and some having more options, others less. Now, I wanted this all under
one hood named AppState or Application state. Some things can be solved using
existing modules using an adapter pattern others needed to be created anew.

Modules
  AppState			Portal to other modules
    $configObject = getConfig;
    $logObject = getLog;
    $processObject = getProcess;
    cleanup;

  AppState::Config		Configuration handling  
    $keys = searchValue( $path, $regex);
    $keys = getKeys($path);

    Output types
      Yaml
      Storable
      MongoDB
      dbm see: http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/perl/cookbook/ch11_15.htm

  AppState::Log			Logging
    Log levels are bit masks each for specific catagories. Keep
    first 16 bits reserved for AppState. Cannot be checked however.
  AppState::Log::Mask		Log mask defs

  AppState::Process		Daemon, fork, process tables etc

  AppState::CommandLine		Options and arguments, CGI

  AppState::Language		Language, Unicode, i18n, i10n
